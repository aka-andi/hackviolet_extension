# todo
- [ ] add a loading spinner for the wait time to do the rainforest API call
- [ ] get the extension to run without having to click the icon + have a notification on the icon once the suggestions are found
- [ ] currently the suggestions go away if you close out of the popup -> instead have it stored until a new page is loaded
